Change History
**************

3.7.1 (2012-02-28)
==================

- Fixed package missing files, without a MANIFEST.in we need setuptools-git.
  [jod]

3.7 (2012-02-28)
================

- Fixed tests.
  [jod]

  easier).
  [gweis]

- Add support for field options `termVectors`, `termPositions` and
  `termOffsets`.
  [gweis]

- Use parts location to find additional jars.
  [gweis]

- Copy dist and contrib folder for Multicore setup (just like for Singlecore).
  [gweis]

- Diabled elevate.xml`, solar would fail to work if this is enabled.
  [gweis]

3.6 (2011-12-07)
================

- Account for new schema validation in Solr 3.4 related to `omitNorms` field.
  [hannosch]

- Update generated config files to match and require Solr 3.5.
  [hannosch]

- Fix `solr-instance purge` to work with hosts/ports other than localhost:8983
  [csenger]

- Added new `extralibs` option to include custom Java libraries

3.5 (2011-07-10)
================

- Removed the `cacheSize` option in favor of 8 specific options to configure
  every aspect of the query caches on their own.
  [hannosch]

- Added new `spellcheckField` option, to configure the source field for the
  spellcheck search component.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the example `tvrh`, `terms` and `elevate` request handlers.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the example `spell` request handler and enabled spell checking based
  on the `default` field for the `search` request handler.
  [hannosch]

- Clean up solrconfig template and remove an example `firstSearcher` query.
  [hannosch]

- Added new `mergeFactor`, `ramBufferSizeMB`, `unlockOnStartup` options.
  [hannosch]

3.4 (2011-07-09)
================

- Update generated config files to match and require Solr 3.3.
  [hannosch]

- Add `solr.WordDelimiterFilterFactory` to the standard text field, to split on
  intra-word delimiters such as `-_:`.
  [hannosch]

3.3 (2011-06-25)
================

- Increase the `requestParsers-multipartUploadLimitInKB` default value from
  2mb to 100mb to allow the `update/extract` handler to accept large files.
  [hannosch]

- Increase Jetty's `maxFormContentSize` from 1mb to 100mb to allow indexing
  large files.
  [hannosch]

- Changed the field definition of the `text` type to avoid filters specific to
  the English language and instead use a default filter config that should work
  with most languages, based on the ICU tokenizer and folding filter.
  [hannosch]

- Load the `analysis-extras` libraries, so we can use the `ICU`-based filters
  and tokenizers.
  [hannosch]

- Removed the clustering request handlers from the default config, as they
  didn't work anyways without us loading the `contrib/clustering` libraries.
  [hannosch]

- Enable `Tika` data extraction and Solr Cell libraries. Data is extracted into
  a field called `tika_content` unless specified otherwise in each request via
  the `fmap.content=` argument. All extracted fields which aren't in the schema
  are put into dynamic fields prefixed with `tika_`.
  [tom_gross, hannosch]

- Removed the Velocity driven `/browse` request handler. The example config
  we generated didn't match the schema.
  [hannosch]

3.2 (2011-06-23)
================

- Added a new option `stopwords-template` which allows you to specify a custom
  stopwords file.
  [hannosch]

3.1 (2011-06-06)
================

- Updated templates to match default found in Solr 3.2.
  [hannosch]

================

- We no longer require elementtree.
  [hannosch]

- Use the standard libraries doctest module.
  [hannosch]

- Increase the `max-num-results` default value from 10 to 500 to avoid
  restricting search results on this low level. The application layer should
  be responsible for making such restrictions.
  [hannosch]

3.0a2 (2011-05-26)
==================

- Added new `logging-template` option and instruct Jetty to use the
  `logging.properties` file. The default logging level is set to `WARNING`.
  [hannosch]

- Pass the `host` option to the Jetty config, so it can be configured to listen
  only on localhost or a specific IP.
  [hannosch]

- Disabled Jetty request log.
  [hannosch]

- Updated `jetty.xml` template to match new defaults found in the Solr 3.1
  release.

  [hannosch]

3.0a1 (2011-05-26)
==================

- Updated the solrconfig.xml template to match the template from Solr 3.1.
  [hannosch]

- Updated the default ``schema.xml`` to the Solr 3.1 format. The schema version
  is now ``1.3`` instead of ``1.2``. The schema is no longer compatible with
  Solr 1.4. Please use a recipe version from the 2.x series for that.

  Changes to the schema include:

  * Fields no longer have a compressed option.

  * The default schema defines three new field types: `point`, `location` and
    `geohash` useful for geospatial data.

  If you have an older Solr 1.4 index, you should be able to continue using it
  without a full reindex.
  [hannosch]

2.1 (2011-04-12)
================

- Fixed reStructuredText.
  [jod]

2.0 (2011-04-12)

    * Refactured to get multicore working.
    * Pinned buildout version to get tests working.

1.1 (2011-04-04)
================

- Make jetty.xml.tmpl honor the host parameter.
  [davidblewett]

- Support for Windows
  [bluszcz]

1.0 (2010-12-12)
================

- No changes.

1.0b5 (2010-09-03)

- Actually provide the default value for the ``cacheSize`` option.
  [hannosch]

1.0b4 (2010-08-12)

==================

- Don't kill solr after script finish when script is just used for starting
  solr as a daemon
  [do3cc]

1.0b2 (2010-06-01)
==================

- Actually do something in the update call. Now the configuration is updated
  when you run buildout again.
  [fschulze]

- Handle termination signal in the wrapper script, so the solr instance is
  killed when the wrapper dies.
  [fschulze]

1.0b1 (2010-05-25)
==================

- Added new ``autoCommitMaxDocs`` and ``autoCommitMaxTime`` options.
  [hannnosch]

- ``logdir`` option internal bugfix: buildout does not allow ``None`` options
  values (__setitem__).
  [anguenot]

1.0a7 (2010-05-17)
==================

- Fixed syntax error in new logdir code.
  [ajung]

1.0a6 (2010-05-17)
==================

- Added ``logdir`` option.
  [ajung]

1.0a5 (2010-05-11)
==================

- Added more options: ``maxWarmingSearchers``, ``useColdSearcher`` and
  ``cacheSize``.
  [hannosch]

1.0a4 (2010-05-05)
==================

- Added back JMX configuration. See http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrJmx for
  more details. You can enable it by adding ``-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote``
  to the ``java_opts`` option.
  [hannosch]

1.0a3 (2010-03-23)
==================

- Added back a field type called ``integer`` with the same properties as the
  ``int`` type. This ensures basic schemas created by ``collective.solr`` won't
  need any schema changes, though they still need a full reindex.
  [hannosch]

1.0a2 (2010-03-22)
==================

- Fixed invalid reStructuredText format in the changelog.
  [hannosch]

1.0a1 (2010-03-22)
==================

- Replaced the ``gettableFiles`` option in the admin section with the new
  ``*.admin.ShowFileRequestHandler`` approach. By default your entire
  ``SOLR_HOME/conf`` except for the ``scripts.conf`` is exposed.
  [hannosch]

- Updated the default ``schema.xml`` to the Solr 1.4 format. The schema version
  is now ``1.2`` instead of ``1.1``. The schema is no longer compatible with
  Solr 1.3. Please use a recipe version from the 0.x series for that.

  Changes to the schema include:

  * The integer field is now called int.

  * New field type attribute ``omitTermFreqAndPositions`` introduced. This is
    true by default except for text fields.

  * New binary and random field types.

  * The int, float, long, double and date fields now use the ``solr.Trie*``
    classes. These are more efficient in general.

  * New tint, tfloat, tlong, tdouble and tdate fields. These are ``solr.Trie*``
    fields with a precisionStep configured. You can use them for fields that
    see a lot of range queries.

  * The old sint, slong, sfloat and sdouble fields are no longer configured.

  * The examples fields text_greek, textTight and alphaOnlySort are no longer
    configured by default.

  * The text field uses the SnowballPorterFilterFactory with a language of
    English instead of the EnglishPorterFilterFactory.

  * The ignored field is now multiValued.

  * No dynamic fields are configured by default.

  If you have an older Solr 1.3 configuration, you might need to adjust it to
  match some of the new defaults. You will also have to do a full reindex of
  Solr, if the type of any of the fields changed, like with int or date fields.
  [hannosch]

- Simplify solrconfig.xml and unconfigure example handlers that rely on a
  specific schema. Other changes include:

  * Indexes are now flushed when the ramBufferSizeMB is exceeded, defaulting to
    32mb instead of every 1000 documents. The maxBufferedDocs is deprecated.

  * The new reopenReaders option causes IndexReaders to be reopened instead of
    closed and then opened.

  * The filterCache uses the solr.FastLRUCache instead of the solr.LRUCache.

  * The queryResultWindowSize defaults to 30 instead of 10.

  * The requestHandler use the new solr.SearchHandler, which supports a
    defType argument to turn it into a dismax handler, instead of having two
    separate classes for the two handlers.

  There is a number of new handlers in Solr 1.4, which aren't enabled by
  default. Read the Solr documentation for the examples.
  [hannosch]

- Updated jetty.xml and solrconfig.xml to Solr 1.4 defaults. The
  ``*.jetty.Request.maxFormContentSize`` has been set to allow post request of
  1mb by default.
  [hannosch]

- Made the tests pass again, by installing more packages into the test buildout
  environment.
  [hannosch]
